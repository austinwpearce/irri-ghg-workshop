Farmers will adapt their practices if there is a sufficient financial incentive. If a farmer can sell in a carbon market the positive outcomes associated with some practice, then there is an incentive to participate in the carbon markets. If those practices with positive outcomes can be implemented at scale, …\nOne characteristic challenge of creating a credit is maximizing the value of the credit while minimizing the cost of creating the credit. A well-designed carbon credit program would be one that has found a way to generate high quality, low risk credits with minimal MRV costs."

It helps with Scope 3 reporting, tracking cradle to gate emissions on the farm. So changes in practices would be reflected in the estimated emissions, but our Platform does not provide MRV services.\nMinimizing the cost of MRV."

    "text": "Farmer Engagement\nCarbon projects often require changes at the farm level. How do project developers or programs effectively engage rice farmers and ensure they receive a fair share of the carbon credit revenue? What strategies help in building trust and participation among farming communities?\nRiceland is a farmer-owned cooperative in the US that is over 100 years old. Riceland launched their Carbon Ready program to assist their coop members in accessing the carbon inset market (scope 3 emission reductions purchased by the rice customers.) Over the 3 year project, they claimed a 95% farmer retention rate. Participating farms received on average $20,000 in annual payouts. Also speaks to the size of the farms.\nThe following they said has helped build trust:\n\nVery transparent with their farmers about what practices they will pay for, how verification will work, and how much they might pay.\nDo not resell the farmers data, the farmer owns the data.\nFarmers can withdraw at anytime before payout with no pressure, no questions asked.\n\nI think that is fair, because again, much of this work is voluntary at the moment, not forced regulation.\n\n\nOne of the board members of Field to Market is actually a rice farmer, and he has participated in various projects and has sold carbon credits. One thing he has shared is that for him, saving money on irrigation pumping due to practices like AWD was also a benefit. Fighting climate warming can be abstract, but saving on irrigation pumping costs is tangible. Maybe there is a lesson there when it comes to selling carbon programs to farmers."

    "text": "Innovations in MRV\nMeasuring emissions from many small rice paddies can be complex. What new tools or innovations (such as digital MRV, remote sensing, or mobile apps) have you found useful in quantifying and verifying emissions reductions for rice carbon projects, and how do they improve feasibility?\n\nAs you know, methane emissions in rice are strongly dependent on flooding status. Let’s consider current programs that are based on asking farmers practicing AWD to take pictures of the fields whenever the field is under a dry down. One issue is the cost of the farmer’s time to take the pictures. But perhaps the bigger issue is that of spatial and temporal variability. Researchers at the University of Arkansas found that flooding status can be highly variable within a field’s boundary, especially at the larger scale of US fields (that can be 40 hectares in size), even when fields are leveled.\nSo, as you mention in number 5, the remote sensing tool is the one we think can be most helpful in the MRV.\nWe have done some work with collaborators from other universities to detect flooding status using satellite data and it is one of the research lines we are looking for more funding."

AgriCapture is focused only on rice supply chains.\n\nLargely done I believe by promoting AWD and furrow irrigation\nAdhering to Soil Enrichment Protocol\nVerified and registered with Climate Action Reserve.\nRated with BeZero Carbon - A rating\n\nHave to dig for rating methods\n\nNot as concerned with permanence as project did not depend on carbon sequestration.\n\nBut they do put in place implementation agreements that serve as a contract to prevent practice reversals for 100 years.\n\n\nQuestion remains: is this a successful project? What is our metric of success?\n\nThat farmers received payments\nThat a credit was sold to the market\nThat practice is permanent and long lasting\nHow do we know"

Are they published? Or do you have to be a customer to find out?\nTransparency is an interesting quality. More transparency can increase trust, but it can also invite criticism and competition. I think overall it is better to be transparent.\n\n\n\nField to Market has a standards committee.\n\nRegularly meet, guide the standards in our own project frameworks, how can the next version of the Fieldprint Platform meet requirements from the GHG Protocol Land Sector Removals Guidance."

Otherwise, it is not feasible to have farmers taking pictures of every field every day. Installing sensors is also expensive, and again they don’t capture the variability inside a field unless we deploy them in several locations.\nIs there a way to group together smallholder farmers for socialized credits? Can we pool together smallholder farmers into a larger cooperative, and the coop sells carbon credits, returning benefits back to the members of the coop? I don’t know."
